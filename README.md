# PHPLOC

`phploc` is a tool for quickly measuring the size and analyzing the structure of a PHP project.

## Installation

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

The easiest way to obtain PHPLOC is to download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) that has all required dependencies of PHPLOC bundled in a single file:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phploc.phar
    chmod +x phploc.phar
    mv phploc.phar /usr/local/bin/phploc

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of course:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phploc.phar
    php phploc.phar

### Composer

Simply add a dependency on `phploc/phploc` to your project's `composer.json` file if you use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a development-time dependency on PHPLOC:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phploc/phploc": "*"
        }
    }

For a system-wide installation via Composer, you can run:

    composer global require 'phploc/phploc=*'

Make sure you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` in your path.

### Analyse a directory for each revision in a Git repository and write the result in CSV format

    ➜ ~ phploc --log-csv log.csv --progress --git-repository . src

### Analyse multiple directories and separate results

By using `--separate` option, you can analyse multiple directories and output their results separately, which are normally merged together. This option will let you output one CSV or XML file, with each directory you provided represented as a separate entity.
